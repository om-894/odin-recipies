        <h1>Lasagna</h1>
        <p>The Meat Sauce is basically just like Bolognese. You need:

            Onion, garlic, carrot and celery for the flavour base, a soffrito;
            
            Beef
            
            Canned tomato and tomato paste
            
            Red wine for extra flavour!
            
            Seasonings: beef bouillon cubes (stock cubes), bay leaves, thyme, oregano, Worcestershire sauce
            
            For the white sauce, you need:
            
            butter
            
            flour
            
            milk
            
            cheese
            
            For assembling, you need:
            
            lasagna sheets, preferably fresh (from the fridge section of grocery stores) but dried works just fine too
            
            cheese!</p>
